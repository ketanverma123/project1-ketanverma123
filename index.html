                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>Iâ€™m a junior Computer Engineering student at Texas A&M University, College Station, class of 2026. I am an Incoming Software Engineering intern at Samsung Semiconductor for the summer of 2025. I have a strong passion for machine learning and semiconductor technology. After graduating, my goal is to join a startup/company focused on AI/ML development that drives innovation for a meaningful cause. Outside of my academic work, I enjoy playing the electric guitar, watching and playing soccer, and contributing to TIDAL, an AI club at TAMU where I help organize workshops and events.</p>
                <p>I was born in Boston, MA, where I spent 7 years, to then move to India, where I grew up and completed my schooling. I spent a lot of time playing the guitar, which helped me ease myself through stressful situations and also is one of my skills till this day which I cherish. Being a curious person, I have had spells of interest in many things. I played badminton for four years in my high school's badminton team, I was a student council board member for two years, I have played soccer for my school's soccer team for the past seven years, and through all this, I have had a lot of character development. Empathy and leadership being the two main soft skills. I take a lot of interest in exploration and visiting new places. Some of the favorite places I have been include California, where skiing on different ranches and visiting downtown San Francisco were the highlights, Florida, where seeing Disney World and visiting the Kennedy Space Center were ticked off my bucket list. In general, I find it intriguing experiencing different places and cultures. Going forward, I strive to produce a positive change in whatever work I take upon and hope my actions spread positivity to those involved. I view each step of my journey as a learning experience and the next step as a way to improve on my previous.</p>
